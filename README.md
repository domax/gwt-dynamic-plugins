gwt-dynamic-plugins
===================

This is a demo project that describes how to build plugin-oriented GWT project. It is not about GWT code split.
Each plugin here is a separate web application that is developed and deployed separately from main/host application.

DONE
----

1. Make 3 Maven modules:
	* __Common__ - a part that is used in host application and in modules/plugins;
	* __Host__ - a startup application that have the main layout and loads modules/plugins dynamically;
	* __Module__ -  the 1st example of module/plugin.
2. Resolve clashes in CSS rules that are generated by host and module apps.
3. Perform dynamic loading modules/plugins that are deployed beside of host app.  
4. Create an easy way to communicate between host and modules. 
5. Add all needed stuff to allow deal with Java beans and JSON as simple as possible
   ([Piriti](https://github.com/hpehl/piriti)).
6. Add into project all needed stuff to make RESTful web-services as easy as possible
   ([RestyGWT](http://restygwt.fusesource.org/)).

TODO
----

1. Add possibility to develop/run/debug all the code as a solid project, but keeping it in the modules.
2. Add 2nd example of module/plugin into project.
3. Add sample of code split usage in modules.
4. Add sample of usage some MVP framework - e.g. [GWTP](https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP).
5. Cover all possible runtime logic with UT:
	* BatchRunner;
	* FeatureConsumers/Providers that send data in serialized form;
	* REST ServiceProviders;
	* REST ServiceConsumers;
	* Presenters logic.
6. Describe classes and methods in JDocs as fully as possible.
7. Add full description of this project and tutorial into Wiki.
8. Apply more or less nice CSS-es to make demo to be presentable.
