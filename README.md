gwt-dynamic-plugins
===================

This is a demo project that describes how to build plugin-oriented GWT project. It is not about GWT code split. 
Each plugin here is a separate web application that is developed and deployed separately, and then loaded into main/host application.

All documentation and instructions were moved to [Wiki](../../wiki)
