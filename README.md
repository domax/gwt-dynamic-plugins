gwt-dynamic-plugins
===================

This is a demo project that describes how to build plugin-oriented GWT project. It is not about GWT code split. 
Each plugin here is a separate web application that is developed and deployed independently, and then loaded into main/host application.

All documentation and instructions were moved to [Wiki](https://github.com/domax/gwt-dynamic-plugins/wiki)

Live demo on Google App Engine is available [here](http://gwt-dynamic-673.appspot.com/).
